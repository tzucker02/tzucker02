- 👋 Hi, I’m Tom Zucker-Scharff (@tzucker02 on github)
- 👀 My current interests are in Data Science because I am working on an online master's degree.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about Linear Algebra (help!!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are in the "Nature" space as I have been a citizen Scientist at the New York Botanical Garden since 2008

- ⚡ Fun fact: I worked for over 30 years at what is now a comprehensive cancer center designated by the National Cancer Center of the NIH.  I was there as the computer guy and enjoyed almost every day of it.  My last few years there were involved heavily in doing data visualization using Power BI.  I now hold a Microsoft certification in Data Analysis in PowerBI.  I have also found that the data visualization software Tableau is extremely powerful and very useful.
