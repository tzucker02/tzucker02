- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Tom Zucker-Scharff (@tzucker02 on github)
- üëÄ My current interests are in Data Science because I am working on an online master's degree.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning all about Linear Algebra (help!!)
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on projects that are in the "Nature" space as I have been a citizen Scientist at the New York Botanical Garden since 2008
- üì´ You can reach me by email

-         or by phone at 914-275-1048   
- üòÑ Pronouns: He, Him, His
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I worked for over 30 years at what is now a comprehensive cancer center designated by the National Cancer Center of the NIH.  I was there as the computer guy and enjoyed almost every day of it.  My last few years there were involved heavily in doing data visualization using Power BI.  I now hold a Microsoft certification in Data Analysis in PowerBI.  I have also found that the data visualization software Tableau is extremely powerful and very useful.
